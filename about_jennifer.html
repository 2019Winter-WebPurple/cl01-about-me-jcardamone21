        <h1>All About Me!</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p><b>Hi there!</b> My name is Jennifer Cardamone, but pretty much everyone calls me Jenn or Jenni. I was born on December 15, in Newark, Delaware and I have lived here my whole life. I am 16 years old and a sophomore at Padua Academy. I live with my mom, dad, older brother, Michael, and pet bird, Larry. I am a vegetarian, lactose interolant, and gluten free. A big part of my life is being Japanese. I am very involved in Japanese culture and being apart of it is definitely one of my favorite things about myself.</p>

        <p>I am very grateful for my family and friends, and I do not know what I would do without them. I am very passionate about feminism and equality for all. I try my best to be kind to everyone because I believe that <b>love</b> is the only way to combat hate. I get anxious and scared very easily, and prefer to plan things out instead of being spontaneous. I love helping people and when I am older I want to be a teacher, therapist, or psychologist.</p>
